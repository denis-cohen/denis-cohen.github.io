title: "Why We Shouldn't Use 83.4% Confidence Intervals"
---

In political science and beyond, researchers often aim to compare estimates across groups. Following the insight that an overlap in 95% confidence intervals of group-specific estimates does not imply statistical insignificance of their difference at the 95% level, practitioners increasingly turn to using 83.4% confidence intervals. The use of 83.4% confidence intervals, however, rests on stringent assumptions about the variances and covariances of the respective group-specific estimates -- which are unlikely to hold in many empirical applications. This opens the door not only to fallacious inferences but, importantly, also to the deliberate manipulation of statistical evidence. This research note cautions against the use of 83.4% confidence intervals and presents both a simple yet effective workflow for assessing the statistical significance of differences between group-specific estimates.
