title: Economic Risk, Anti-Immigration Preferences, and Voting for the Radical Right 
---

While extensive research stresses the importance of economic insecurity and immigration-
skeptic nativism for radical right support, little is known about the synergy
between economic and attitudinal explanations. In this paper, I make the case for
a risk-based conceptualization of economic insecurity and argue that perceptive links
between immigration and economic risk attract economically vulnerable individuals to
the radical right's anti-immigration platform. Restrictive immigration preferences are
therefore a defining link by which economic risk translates into radical right support. I
use an explicit mediation model to test the relevance of this mechanism in comparative
perspective. My findings show that economic risk indeed promotes radical right voting
by way of shaping immigration preferences, and does so most strongly where demand for
immigration restriction is met with sufficient political supply on the part of the radical
right. These findings offer important implications for the study of political attitudes,
preferences and political behavior.
