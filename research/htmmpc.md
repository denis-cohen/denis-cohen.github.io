title: "How To Model Multi-Party Competition in a Transforming Political Space?"
---

A large body of literature focuses on the restructuring of the political space in postindustrial Western Europe. While many contributions study the relationship between niche party success and mainstream party repositioning on new salient conflict dimensions, we still know little about how mainstream party repositioning affects the compositions of their own electorates. In this contribution, we introduce a novel conceptual and operational framework for studying how party strategies affect voter retention, defection, and attraction in multiparty systems. Specifically, we analyze the effects of mainstream party repositioning on immigration policy on the voters they keep, win, and lose. We argue that changes in mainstream parties' immigration platforms alert voters to the conflict dimension and to the parties that are most outspoken about the issue -- green and radical right parties, which occupy opposite poles on this issue dimension. We show that mainstream party shifts catalyze bidirectional voter transfers between mainstream and niche parties and do not result in favorable electoral outcomes for mainstream parties. We thereby establish that the increase in voter migration between mainstream and niche parties in response to mainstream party policy shifts constitutes an important mechanism for explaining the consolidation of radical right and green parties in West European party systems.
