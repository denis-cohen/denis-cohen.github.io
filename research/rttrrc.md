title: Responding to the Radical Right Challenge -- Party Shifts and Voter Reactions
---

In seeking to curtail the success of radical right challengers, many parties pursue
accommodative strategies - they coopt radical right issue positions in an attempt to
gain or regain voters. It is, however, unclear whether these strategies yield the desired
effects of winning back previous radical right voters or of expanding parties' electorate.
In order to address these question, we study the repercussions of party shifts with
respect to issues of national identity on voter migration between parties, combining
micro-level data on electoral behavior from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems
with data on party platforms from the Comparative Manifesto Project. The findings of
our comparative inquiry show that 'going tough' on issues of national identity has little
to no pay-off: Parties that employ these strategies are not significantly more successful
at swaying voters from the radical right, non-voters, or from other parties. This holds
for members of all major party families alike.
