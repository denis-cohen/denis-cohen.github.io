title: Between Strategy and Protest. How Policy Demand, Political Dissatisfaction and Strategic Incentives Matter for Far-Right Voting
---

What attracts voters to far right parties? Emphasizing the repercussions of
far right parties' past achievements on the mobilization of voters' electoral
demand, this paper develops a context-dependent strategic choice calculus for far
right voting. Far right parties seek to mobilize on a combination of demand for
nativist policies and anti-establishment protest sentiment. Their capacity of doing so,
however, critically depends on the strategic incentives they supply. My findings from a
comparative analysis based on six waves of the European Election Study show that far
right parties' past attainment of legislative strength boosts the credibility of their policy
appeal and broadens the scope of their protest appeal whereas their participation in
government jeopardizes their capacity to mobilize on popular discontent.
